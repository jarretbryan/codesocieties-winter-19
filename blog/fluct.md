title: we play programmed
subtitle: Day 11 ~ led by FlucT on January 18th 2019

we play programmed. is a class about performance, not just as an art but performance as behavior.

We prioritize certain behaviors curated by social programming, whether by poetry or by survival. Through dissecting Fluct’s latest work ‘everythingmakesmehappy.’, we will discuss the processes used to create performance aimed at exposing and ultimately interrupting the psychology of social programming. With fluid interruption, responsive support and acute presence, we are aiming to disable oppressive structures in order to become the authors of our existence.<br>

I feel like I need to preface this blog post by saying that I'm still not sure about what I saw or what it did to me, but I know that I'm different after seeing FlucT's performance. The only thing that I can think to compare this experience to is reading a book that jars me ideologically, changes my conception of possibility, gives me a new framework for approaching the experience of being a person with a body in a place.

FlucT is a performance collaborative created by Sigrid Lauren & Monica Mirabile. Their work prods at the tensions of capital obedience in American culture through choreography and performance. They've performed at techno festivals, gallery spaces, art fairs, and now, for Code Society students in a dance studio around the corner from SFPC. The experience, holistically, was incredibly cinematic - imagine sitting in an old dance studio in a historic building right by Hudson River Park facing a beautiful view of the southern Manhatten skyline and seeing an experimental performance collaborative do things with their bodies that you have never seen people do with their bodies to a dissonant soundtrack of athleisure ads, techno music, samples from America's Got Talent. This really sounds like a scene from risky indie coming of age movie, but I'm not complaining. 

FlucT started their class with a workshop that was really more of an invitation - an invitation to actively recognize and engage in the ways that our bodies are existing in relation to one another. In pairs, we mimicked the movements of our partner while maintaining eye contact for the entire duration. I want to say that we did it for five minutes, but my conceptualization of time might have collapsed during this activity. There were moments where it felt entirely too long, excruciating even, and moments where I never wanted it to end. Have you ever looked into someone's eyes for so long that you lost track of time?  It is hard to look at someone in the eyes for that long and not have affection for them. I know this probably sounds lame, but bear with me - it's my truth. It's fun and intimate, intimately fun, to learn the limitations of another person's corporeal form, whether they can bend this way or whether they are uncomfortable stretching to this angle. There was no verbal acknowledgment of who would lead when or who would follow. We all silently consigned to have control or to be controlled.

Following this activity FlucT left the room to prepare for their performance and the lights in the studio were turned off. In hindsight, this was really where the performance began for me. The darkness felt like yet another invitation - an invitation to dump any sensorial baggage that I'd entered the room with so that I could be open to whatever I was about to see.

The conceptual sections of their performance break down as follows: 
- (00:00) "I will not hurt myself, I will not hurt you..."
- (00:00 - 03:30) Nonconsensual Media Absorption
- (3:30 - 06:10) Motives/Nondiegetic sound and movement
- (6:10 - 08:50) Creating Language: Gaping, Gushing, Glitching
- (8:50 - 012:00) Play to Program/ Antidote to systemic conditioning
- (12:00 - 15:00) Support: Physical & Emotional Mentalism
- (15:00 - 17:50) "America's Got Talent" (Conversation on culture)
- (17:50 - 20:30) The Abject
- (20:30 - 22:30) "I wanna open My Presence" (Projection as a tool)
- (22:30 - 23:50) Body as a Tool (Confidence in being an active participant)
- (23:50 - 25:00) The Freak Out: A release and a response

FlucT ended our experience together with another invitation - this time to walk the space to the sounds of [Lotic's Love and Light](https://soundcloud.com/lotic/love-and-light). We started slowly, adjusting to moving in our bodies again after sitting for so long, but faster as we resettled into ourselves and it began to feel as if we were in ritual, dancing with one another. At the end of the song we formed a circle with our back to one another and extended the palm of our right hands onto the back of the person in front of us. In this position, we stood and felt one another breathe. 

I don't have the words to describe this feeling to you, reader, or at least not in a way that I feel comfortable sharing in a blog post that just anyone can read, but it was very beautiful and I felt intensely fortunate to be able to experience it. I hope that you get to see FlucT perform someday (if you haven't already), and that you are gentle with yourself afterward - accommodating in the space you allot to reflect, digest, absorb.
